# arduinoWeatherStation
A minutes gift for Mrs. Fletcher's class from November 12th, 2021.

Displays temperature in Celsius and Fahrenheit, and humidity.
It is a simple Arduino project using only a DHT11, Arduino UNO, and a 128x32 OLED I2C display.

Thanks to Adafruit for making amazing guides and libraries!
